# Invoice App / Billing App for LB-Phone (OKOKBilling - QB)

# Backstory
Unable to locate any free resources on this particular subject, I took it upon myself to create a solution for the community and individuals who have been searching for this. It is licensed under GNU as I do not believe in charging individuals for just a few lines of code.


# Credits:
I would like to give credit to maxifaxipaxi for the Flappy Bird game, from which I borrowed some lines: https://lb.mfpscripts.com/

# add to lb-phone\config\config.json:


```
        "voopsie": {
             "name": "Voopsie",
             "removable": true,
             "size": 2000
        },
```

# Disclaimer:

This should also be compatible with ESX, as long as the export for the billing menu matches that of qb.
